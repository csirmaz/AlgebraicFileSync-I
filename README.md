# Algebraic File Syncronization

This repository contains the sources of two papers on algebraic file synchronization and related scripts for automated proofs.

## An Algebraic Approach to File Synchronization

Directory p1 holds the latest source of the paper written as a Research Science Institute project and which
formed the basis of:

Norman Ramsey and Elod Csirmaz. An Algebraic Approach to File Synchronization.
In _Proceedings of the Joint 8th European Software Engineering Conference and 
9th ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering._ ACM Press, 2001. 175â€“185.

## Algebraic File Synchronization: Adequacy and Completeness

Directory p2 holds the latest source of a new paper that introduces a novel set of filesystem commands
and presents rigorous proofs that update detection and reconciliation 
not only work as intended, but also cannot be improved on.
