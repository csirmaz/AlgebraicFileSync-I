\section{Investigating Command Pairs}\label{section_axioms}

So that we can describe the effects of commands in general,
let us introduce some notation
and note some observations.
We already know that
commands usually do not occur in isolation,
and are applied to filesystems in time.
Therefore we will investigate sequences of commands with a well-defined order.
\begin{mydef}[Sequences of commands: $\cc$ and $\emptyseq$]
We use ``$\cc$'' to concatenate commands to form a sequence, or concatenate sequences to form a longer sequence,
with the meaning that the command on the left is applied first:
\[ \alpha\cc\beta\aFS = \beta(\alpha\aFS). \]
For example, we will write
$S=\cbdaa{n}{\vald}\cc\cbfaa{m}{\valf}$, or $S'=S\cc\cbba{o}$.
% monoid, but not free monoid
% monoid: semigroup with identity element
% Sequences of commands form a free semigroup
Sequences of commands form a monoid, and, as usual,
$\emptyseq$ denotes its unit element, the empty sequence,
which by definition leaves all filesystems unchanged.
\end{mydef}

The following two relations 
(which echo the ones defined in \cite{NREC})
allow us to investigate sequences independently of filesystems.
In the definitions, $A,B,S,T$ stand for arbitrary sequences of commands.

\begin{mydef}[$\eqext$]
% Relation in the algebra
$A\eqext B$ means that $B$ extends $A$,
% intended interpretation:
that is, they behave in the same way
on any filesystem $A$ does not break:
$\forall \FS: A\FS\neq\fsbroken\Rightarrow A\aFS=B\aFS$.
% preorder: reflexive and transitive
It is a preorder,
and as clearly
% inference rules:
$ A\eqext B \Rightarrow S\cc A\cc T\eqext S\cc B\cc T$,
it is a precongruence.
% precongruence: congruence of a preorder -- TODO -- ?
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}[$\equiv$]
% Relation in the algebra
$A\equiv B$,
or $A$ and $B$ are \emph{equivalent,}
iff $A\eqext B$ and $B\eqext A$;
that is, $\equiv$ is the intersection of the preorder $\equext$ with its inverse.
% symmetric: aRb <=> bRa
% reflexive: aRa
% transitive: aRb & bRC => aRc
It is therefore a congruence, and we can see that
% inference rule:
$ A\equiv B \Rightarrow S\cc A\cc T\equiv S\cc B\cc T $.
\end{mydef}

It is easy to see that equivalence holds on the level of filesystems:

\begin{mylem}
$A\equiv B$
iff $A$ and $B$ behave in the same way on
all filesystems, that is, $\forall \FS: A\aFS=B\aFS$.
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}
If $\forall \FS: A\aFS=B\aFS$ then $A\eqext B$ and $B\eqext A$ and so by definition $A\equiv B$.
For the reverse statement we assume that $A\equext B$ and $B\equext A$.
$B\equext A$ implies that it is not possible for both $B\aFS\neq\fsbroken$ and $A\aFS=\fsbroken$ to be true.
Therefore, for every $\FS$ either $A\aFS\neq\fsbroken$, in which case $A\aFS=B\aFS$ as $A\eqext B$, or $A\aFS=\fsbroken$,
in which case $B\aFS=\fsbroken$ must be true, and therefore $A\aFS=B\aFS$ still holds.
\end{proof}


Our aim is to derive information about the effects of sequences
of commands independently of the actual filesystems.
In order to make this possible, we investigate the smallest building
blocks of sequences: pairs of commands that act on a filesystem directly one after the other.
This approach is useful as there are a limited number of command pairs,
because, as we argued above, we can disregard the exact output values of commands apart from their type,
and we can also abstract the relationship between the nodes in the two commands
to a finite number of cases.

We methodically investigated of all possibilities using a computer 
program\footnote{The program is accessible on-line at \\
https://github.com/csirmaz/AlgebraicSyncPaper/blob/master/p2/prove.py.}
to determine
which pairs of commands cause errors all the time,
which can be simplified to one or no commands, and which commute and can be reversed
without any change in their overall effect.
Our basis for this investigation was the model of filesystems introduced in this paper.
These properties of command pairs are crucial as they determine
how a set of commands can be re-ordered to be applied to a filesystem
during synchronization, and what commands will never be compatible.
Below we list a number of statements derived using this method.

\bigskip

\noindent
Pairs of commands in general have the form
\[ \cxynv\cc  \czwmv \]
where $X,Y,Z,W\in\typeset$, $n,m\in\setn$, 
and values are of the appropriate type: 
$\valvy\in\setvx{Y}$ and $\valvw\in\setvx{W}$.

\begin{myax}\label{ax_separate_commute}
Commands on incomparable nodes commute:
$\cxynv\cc\czwmv \equiv \czwmv\cc\cxynv$ where $n\unrel m$.
\end{myax}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_separate_nobreaks}
Commands on incomparable nodes do not break every filesystem:
$\cxynv\cc\czwmv \nequiv \cbrk$ where $n\unrel m$.
\end{myax}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_same_breaks}
Commands on the same node break every filesystem if their types are incompatible:
$\cxynv\cc\czwnv \equiv \cbrk$ where $Y\ne Z$.
\end{myax}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_same_emptyseq}
Commands on the same node simplify:
$\cxynv\cc\czwnv \eqext \emptyseq$ where $Y=Z$, and $X=W=\ccharb$ 
or $X=W=\cchard$.
\end{myax}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_same_singlec}
Commands on the same node simplify:
$\cxynv\cc \czwnv \equiv \cxwnv$ where $Y=Z$ and $\cxw\neq\cbb$ and $\cxw\neq\cdd$.
\end{myax}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_distantrel_breaks}
Commands on distant relatives break all filesystems:
$\cxynnv\cc\czwnv \equiv \cbrk$
and $\czwnv\cc\cxynnv \equiv\cbrk$
where $\nn\descendant n$ and $\nn\neq\parent(n)$ and $\cxy\neq\cdd$ and $\czw\neq\cbb$.
\end{myax}

\begin{mydef}[Construction pair]
A pair of commands on nodes $\nn$ and $n$ is a construction pair if $\nn=\parent(n)$ 
and the commands are one
of the following:
   \begin{gather*}
            \cbdaa{\nn}{\vald}\cc  \cbfaa{n}{\valf} \\
            \cbdaa{\nn}{\vald}\cc  \cbdaa{n}{\vald} \\
            \cfdaa{\nn}{\vald}\cc  \cbfaa{n}{\valf} \\
            \cfdaa{\nn}{\vald}\cc  \cbdaa{n}{\vald}
   \end{gather*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_directchild_breaks}
All other commands on a child break every filesystem:
$\cxynnv\cc\czwnv \equiv \cbrk$ where $\nn=\parent(n)$ and $\cxy\neq\cdd$ and $\czw\neq\cbb$
and the pair is not a construction pair.
\end{myax}

\begin{mydef}[Destruction pair]
A pair of commands on nodes $n$ and $\nn$ is a destruction pair if $\parent(n)=\nn$ and the commands are one
of the following:
   \begin{gather*}
            \cfba{n}\cc  \cdba{\nn} \\
            \cfba{n}\cc  \cdfaa{\nn}{\valf} \\
            \cdba{n}\cc  \cdba{\nn} \\
            \cdba{n}\cc  \cdfaa{\nn}{\valf}
   \end{gather*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_directparent_breaks}
All other commands on a parent break every filesystem:
$\cxynv\cc\czwnnv \equiv \cbrk$ where $\parent(n)=\nn$ and $\cxy\neq\cbb$ and $\czw\neq\cdd$
and the pair is not a destruction pair.
\end{myax}

\begin{mydef}[Assertion command]
A command is an assertion command if
for every filesystem it either breaks it or leaves it in the same state.
In other words, assertion commands have the same input and output type,
and there must also be only one possible value for their output.
Accordingly, $\cbba{n}$ and $\cdda{n}$ are the only two assertion commands.
\end{mydef}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_child_assert}
An assertion command can be added on a descendant node:
\[ \cbba{n}\cc\cxynnv \equiv \cxynnv \equiv \cxynnv\cc\cbba{n} \] 
where $\nn\descendant n$ and $\cxy\neq\cdd$.
(Note that this and next rule is true because the assertion command is
adjacent to the original command.)
\end{myax}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_parent_assert}
An assertion command can be added on an ancestor node:
\[ \cdda{\nn}\cc\cxynv \equiv \cxynv \equiv \cxynv\cc\cdda{\nn} \]
where $\nn\descendant n$ and $\cxy\neq\cbb$.
\end{myax}

\begin{myax}\label{ax_assert}
Assertion commands can be removed:
$\cxynv \eqext \emptyseq$ where $\cxy=\cbb$ or $\cxy=\cdd$.
\end{myax}



\bigskip

\noindent
We also define the concept of two commands being independent:

\begin{mydef}[$A\indep B$: Independent commands, sequences and sets]\label{def_indep}
Two commands $\cxynv$ and $\czwmv$ 
are independent, and we write $\cxynv\indep\czwmv$ if 
they have the same effect in either order and do not break all filesystems:
\[ \cxynv\cc\czwmv \equiv \czwnv\cc\cxynv \nequiv \cbrk. \]
For two sequences or unordered sets of commands $A$ and $B$ we write $A\indep B$ if
for all $\alpha$ in $A$ and all $\beta$ in $B$, $\alpha\indep\beta$.
\end{mydef}

It is intentional that we use the same symbol for independent commands
and sequences as for incomparable nodes. As we will see in the next
\namecref{incomparable_is_independent},
these two concepts are closely related.

\begin{mylem}\label{incomparable_is_independent}
Two different commands that are not assertion commands are independent iff the nodes they change are incomparable:
\[ \cxynv\indep\czwmv \Leftrightarrow n\unrel m \]
if $\cxynv\neq\czwmv$ and none of $\cxy$ and $\cxw$ is $\cbb$ or $\cdd$.
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}
This is easy to show based on the output of the software that investigates the behavior of command pairs.
However, this proposition can also be derived from the \namecrefs{ax_separate_commute} already listed
in the following way.

We proceed in two steps. First, we note that
from \cref{ax_separate_commute,ax_separate_nobreaks} we know that
if $n\unrel m$, then $\cxynv$ and $\czwmv$ must necessarily be independent, and therefore
$ \cxynv\nindep\czwmv \wedge n\unrel m $ cannot be the case.

Next, we prove that
\[ \cxynv\indep\czwmv \wedge n\nunrel m \] is also impossible as it would lead to contradiction.
As $n\nunrel m$
we know that $n=m$, $n\descendant m$ or $m\descendant n$.

If $n=m$, then from \cref{ax_same_breaks} we know $Y=Z$ and $W=X$
as otherwise the commands, in one order or the other, would break all filesystems
and they could not be independent.
The commands are not assertion commands, and so from \cref{ax_same_singlec}
we know that $\cxynv\cc\czwnv\equiv\czwnv\cc\cxynv$ can only happen if $Y=W$ and $\valvy=\valvw$.
Therefore $X=Y=Z=W$ which is only possible if both commands are $\cff$ and have the same
output value. This, however, contradicts our assumption that they are different.

If $n\descendant m$ or $m\descendant n$, then
from \cref{ax_distantrel_breaks} we know that if they are not directly related,
then $\cxynv\cc\czwmv$ breaks all filesystems, and they cannot be independent.
From the construction and destruction pairs and 
\cref{ax_directchild_breaks,ax_directparent_breaks} we also see that
even if they are directly related, either
$\cxynv\cc\czwmv$ or $\czwmv\cc\cxynv$ 
breaks all filesystems, so they again cannot be independent.
\end{proof}
