If we start with two copies of the filesystem $\FS$,
and two different sequences are applied to the copies to yield $\FS_A:=A\aFS$
and $\FS_B:=B\aFS$, then our aim is to define sequences of commands $\reca$ and $\recb$
so that $\recb\aFS_A$ and $\reca\aFS_B$ would be as close to each other as possible.

We work based on the assumption that to achieve this, we need
to apply to $\FS_B$ the commands that have been applied to $\FS_A$, and \emph{vice versa}.
As some commands may have been applied to both filesystems, our first approximation
is $\reca = A\setminus B$ and $\recb = B\setminus A$
(in some suitable order).
This, however, will break both filesystems if there have been incompatible updates
in $A$ and $B$. 
Our aim is therefore to provide an algorithm that selects the commands 
$\reca \subset A\setminus B$
and $\recb \subset B\setminus A$ 
so that $\reca\aFS_B\neq\fsbroken$ and $\recb\aFS_A\neq\fsbroken$,
and show that these are the longest sequences with this property, that is,
adding any command left out from $\reca$ or $\recb$ will break the filesystems.

We assume that $A$ and $B$ are returned by an update detector,
and so they are simple sequences.
(Otherwise, they can be simplified to become simple sequences; see \cref{update_works}.)
We also assume that $\FS_A$ and $\FS_B$ are not broken.
With these assumptions,
we can now define our reconciliation algorithm.

\begin{mydef}[Reconciliation]\label{def:reconciliation}
We determine $\reca$---which we apply to $\FS_B$ 
to reconcile it with $\FS_A$---to be
the largest subset of $A\setminus B$
that is independent of $B\setminus A$:
\begin{align*}
\reca = \{\alpha|{}& \\
& \alpha\in A\setminus B \\
& \wedge \\
& \forall \beta\in B\setminus A: \alpha\indep\beta\\
\}. &
\end{align*}
The order of commands in the sequence can be determined using the algorithm described in
\cref{ordering} as any subset of $A$ is also simple.
In a similar way, $\recb$ can be obtained by reversing $A$ and $B$
in the definition.
\end{mydef}

We would now like to prove that $\reca$ and $\recb$ can be applied to the replicas,
that is, without loss of generality,
\[ \reca\aFS_B\neq\fsbroken. \]
So that we can formalize statements needed to prove this,
let us introduce two relations that describe under what conditions
sequences of commands work, that is, do not break a filesystem.
